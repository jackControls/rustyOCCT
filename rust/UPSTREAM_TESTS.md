# Running original OCCT tests against Rust

The bridge evaluates the original DRAW Tcl tests through either the Rust command
adapter or native OCCT's `DRAWEXE`. It uses a real Tcl interpreter, the original
`CheckCommands.tcl` assertions and `_check_log` result parser, plus group/grid
setup, teardown and parsing rules. No expected values or test bodies are
translated, patched, or generated from Rust results.

This is an incremental compatibility host, not the full DRAW application. Both
backends run in batch mode without opening a viewer. Native DRAW may link the
distribution's visualization libraries; they are test dependencies only. The
production Rust crate remains dependency-free and forbids unsafe code.

## Run

Requires Python 3.9+, Tcl 8.5+, Rust and a Unix host. Native comparison also needs
OCCT's installed DRAW executable and modeling plugins. Ordinary Rust tests still
run on Windows without Tcl or OCCT.

```sh
# Rust only; explicit expected unsupported/missing cases remain non-passes:
python3 rust/tools/run_upstream_tests.py

# Same original tests on both implementations:
python3 rust/tools/run_upstream_tests.py --backend both --draw-exe /path/to/DRAWEXE

# Verify the harness catches deliberately broken assertions and crashes:
python3 -m unittest discover -s rust/tools -p test_draw_bridge.py -v

# Also cross-check signed boxes, transforms, properties and tolerance boundaries:
RUSTY_TEST_DRAW_EXE=/path/to/DRAWEXE python3 -m unittest discover -s rust/tools -p test_draw_bridge.py -v
```

The runner discovers `DRAWEXE` or Ubuntu's `occt-draw` on PATH; the macOS
fallback is `/opt/homebrew/opt/opencascade/bin/DRAWEXE`. Use
`--case tests/bugs/modalg_7/bug29311_5` to select a registered test,
`--data-dir /path/to/test-data` for existing fixtures, and `--timeout 30` to set
the per-case time limit. No data files are downloaded automatically.

Reports are written to `target/upstream-tests/report.json`, `junit.xml`, and
per-case `output.log` files. They record native version/build details, source
revision, dirty Rust files, source/worker hashes, commands, observed query count,
original OCCT adjudication, unsupported commands and missing fixtures. A fresh
process and shape table isolate every test; timeout kills the whole process
group, and stale success records are removed before each run.

## Current coverage contract

| Original case | Rust | Native OCCT 7.9.3 | What it exercises |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `bugs/modalg_7/bug29311_5` | Pass | Pass | Disjoint AABBs, both operand orders |
| `bugs/modalg_7/bug29311_6` | Pass | Pass | AABB containment, both orders |
| `bugs/modalg_7/bug29311_7` | Pass | Pass | AABB overlap, both orders |
| `bugs/modalg_7/bug29311_8` | Unsupported | Pass | Oriented boxes, a capability sentinel |
| `bugs/modalg_6/bug28189_2` | Unsupported | Pass | Boolean common of wire compounds |
| `bugs/modalg_6/bug28189_3` | Unsupported | Pass | Boolean union of wire compounds |
| `bugs/modalg_1/buc60684` | Missing fixture | Missing fixture | External `buc60684a.brep` data |

There are **three original geometry tests passing on both backends**, not seven.
The 17 bridge self-tests are separate infrastructure checks; they do not count
as more upstream coverage. The existing 66-solid / 2,292-classification native
oracle corpus supplies much broader prism geometry checks independently.

CI runs the bridge and both backends on Ubuntu 24.04 and uploads the reports.
That distribution's OCCT runtime is recorded in each report separately from
the local 7.9.3 oracle and the source fork point. Pin a source-built oracle to
the application's exact SDK before making release-parity claims.

`fixtures/upstream-draw.json` explicitly declares each expected backend status.
An unexpected failure, timeout, capability loss, new success, fixture availability
change or source-file change fails the coverage contract. **Exit zero means
the declared contract holds**, including its declared gaps. JUnit represents
unsupported/missing/known-failure cases as skipped, never as successful tests.
The JSON records which cases actually passed original assertions on both sides;
a Rust-only run makes no new live parity claim.

## Deliberate limits

- Rust signatures: positional `box` with three or six numbers, two-name `copy`,
  single-shape `ttranslate`/`trotate`, `checkshape`, unique `nbshapes`, `vprops`
  with optional positive integration epsilon, `isdraw`, the solid identification
  needed by `checkprops`, and AABB `isbbinterf`. Everything else is unsupported,
  including OBBs, `sprops`, `nbshapes -t`, option-form boxes and visualization.
- Test geometry remains boxes and rigidly transformed copies. The adapter
  intentionally does not expose every Rust prism capability yet. More command
  adapters must delegate to real kernel functions, never return canned success.
- Metadata `help` registers no UI help; `cpulimit` is handled by the outer wall
  timeout. An existing topology-check registration avoids `bugs/begin` loading
  a viewer. These administrative differences do not skip geometry assertions.
- A safe child interpreter supplies Tcl control flow and prevents tests from
  launching processes or writing files. This is isolation for trusted pinned
  tests, not a security sandbox for arbitrary untrusted native DRAW input.
- Unsupported commands and missing fixtures are latched outside the child, so
  `catch` cannot turn them into passes. No-observation scripts are unverified.
  Upstream BAD/TODO and IMPROVEMENT results are distinct from passes. Original
  assertions retain their own tolerances, sometimes much looser than the
  separate numerical oracle; passing them is not a universal error guarantee.
- OCCT's C++ GoogleTest files are not run against Rust yet. Their APIs cannot be
  linked directly to a Rust crate. A future narrow, test-only C ABI/C++ adapter
  could compile selected original tests unchanged; otherwise reuse their inputs
  and assertions with explicit attribution and label them translated tests.

## Extend coverage

Read the original command implementation and the complete test context. Add
only modeling/query commands needed by noBS-CAD, plus real Rust functionality.
Choose an original test with public fixtures, record the SHA-256 of it and all
of its setup/parser dependencies in the manifest, and require native success
before promoting Rust coverage. Register missing capability/data cases explicitly.
Do not strip viewer calls from a file and then count it as an unchanged passing
test: classify it outside the headless subset or create a separately attributed
derived case. Do not use a success percentage across all OCCT suites as the
readiness metric; measure evidence against the documented kernel capabilities,
numerical domains and failure contracts independently of any application.
