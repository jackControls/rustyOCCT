# Source-driven implementation

Use the original implementation, its callers and its tests together when
porting a capability. The source baseline is OCCT commit
`3d097a0328e71b826377d4814ab05ec3c3d23871`, retained in this repository.
The runtime oracle version is recorded separately: local OCCT 7.9.3 and the
Ubuntu 24.04 distribution build in CI are not builds of that source commit.

## Current traceability

The table distinguishes behavior ported from source from an independent
analytic implementation checked against OCCT. It does not claim a line-for-line
translation of the current Rust kernel.

| Rust behavior | Original source and contract | Implementation / evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Tolerance::default` | [Precision.hxx](../src/FoundationClasses/TKernel/Precision/Precision.hxx), `Confusion()` and `Angular()` | Same `1e-7` and `1e-12` defaults. Rust additionally validates supplied tolerances and rejects unresolvable coordinates. |
| `Solid::box_at` | [BRepPrimAPI_MakeBox.cxx](../src/ModelingAlgorithms/TKPrim/BRepPrimAPI/BRepPrimAPI_MakeBox.cxx), `pmin` and point/signed-size constructor | Negative dimensions move the minimum corner; absolute dimensions define positive volume. All eight sign combinations checked in Rust and through native DRAW. Zero/sub-tolerance sizes remain errors. Existing `cuboid` still takes positive dimensions. |
| `Bounds3::intersects` | [Bnd_Box.cxx](../src/FoundationClasses/TKMath/Bnd/Bnd_Box.cxx), finite/non-open branch of `IsOut` | Ported separation comparisons, sum of both gaps, inclusive touching. No infinite, void or open-bound box representation. This is broad-phase overlap, not exact collision. |
| `RigidTransform::rotation` | [gp_Trsf.cxx](../src/FoundationClasses/TKMath/gp/gp_Trsf.cxx), axis rotation: translation `origin - R*origin` | Same pivot semantics, independently expressed with Rust vectors. No mirror or scale. Transform tests and native DRAW checks. |
| `Solid::extrude` | [BRepPrimAPI_MakePrism.cxx](../src/ModelingAlgorithms/TKPrim/BRepPrimAPI/BRepPrimAPI_MakePrism.cxx) and [BRepSweep_Prism.cxx](../src/ModelingAlgorithms/TKPrim/BRepSweep/BRepSweep_Prism.cxx) | Specialized finite normal extrusion of a material profile. Reject thickness at/below linear tolerance, matching the finite prism's vector-length guard. General swept subshapes, oblique/infinite prisms and OCCT history APIs are not implemented. |
| Cylinder seam topology | [BRepPrim_OneAxis.cxx](../src/ModelingAlgorithms/TKPrim/BRepPrim/BRepPrim_OneAxis.cxx), lateral-face pcurves | Rust retains one shared seam edge with two opposed uses and distinct surface pcurves. This is a specialized builder, not a port of the complete one-axis builder. Topology, normals and 66-solid oracle tests. |
| Mass, bounds, classification | [BRepGProp.cxx](../src/ModelingAlgorithms/TKTopAlgo/BRepGProp/BRepGProp.cxx), [BRepClass3d_SolidClassifier.cxx](../src/ModelingAlgorithms/TKTopAlgo/BRepClass3d/BRepClass3d_SolidClassifier.cxx), `BRepBndLib::AddOptimal` | Independently derived exact prism formulas and profile classification, checked against these native OCCT APIs. The general algorithms have not been ported. |
| DRAW adapter | [BRepTest_PrimitiveCommands.cxx](../src/Draw/TKTopTest/BRepTest/BRepTest_PrimitiveCommands.cxx) and [BRepTest_BasicCommands.cxx](../src/Draw/TKTopTest/BRepTest/BRepTest_BasicCommands.cxx) | Small command/signature subset delegates to Rust geometry; Tcl remains the real interpreter. `isbbinterf` uses the finite AABB logic above for box solids. |
| Original test judgments | [CheckCommands.tcl](../resources/DrawResources/CheckCommands.tcl), [TestCommands.tcl](../resources/DrawResources/TestCommands.tcl), group/grid `begin`, `end`, `parse.rules` and selected original tests | Execute original files without rewriting expected values. SHA-256 manifest pins every participating upstream file. Known failures, unsupported behavior and absent data are not passes. |

The original copyright/license notices remain in the inherited source. Rust
additions use LGPL-2.1-only WITH OCCT-exception-1.0; algorithmic ports should
retain source attribution here and beside the relevant implementation.

## Rule for the next capability

1. Find the noBS-CAD caller and its input/output, error, tolerance and selection
   contracts. Do not expand into rendering or unrelated OCCT infrastructure.
2. Read the OCCT entry point **and the algorithm it calls**, including degenerate
   branches, orientation, periodicity, tolerance propagation and history maps.
   Record files, symbols and source revision in this table.
3. Select upstream regressions and native oracle observations before writing the
   Rust implementation. Capture a native result independently of Rust output.
4. Implement idiomatic Rust ownership and errors while preserving the supported
   behavior. Record deliberate restrictions or divergences; never silently
   substitute a mesh or bounding box for an exact operation.
5. Add primitive-level, invariant and application replay checks. A test becoming
   supported requires a manifest review, not automatic baseline regeneration.
6. Treat discovered OCCT defects as reviewed divergences with an analytic or
   independent reference, not defects we must reproduce for the sake of parity.
